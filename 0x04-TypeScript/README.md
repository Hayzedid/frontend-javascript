# 0x04. TypeScript

This project covers TypeScript basics: types, interfaces, classes, DOM interaction, namespaces, ambient declarations, declaration merging, and nominal typing.

## Structure
- task_0: Student interface and DOM table rendering
- task_1: Teacher/Directors interfaces, printTeacher, StudentClass
- task_2: Director/Teacher classes, createEmployee, isDirector, executeWork, teachClass
- task_3: Ambient namespace declarations and usage (crud)
- task_4: Namespaces & declaration merging (Subjects)
- task_5: Brand convention & nominal typing

## Build
From each task directory:
- Install deps if needed: `npm install`
- Build: `npm run build`

TypeScript should compile without warnings or errors.
